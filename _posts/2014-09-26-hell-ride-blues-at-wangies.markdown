A few shots from [The Hell Ride Blues'](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Hell-Ride-Blues/120158028013667) gig at Wangies (no, I'm not making the name
of the place up...) last night as part of 2014's [Salford Music Festival](http://www.salfordmusicfestival.co.uk/).  So
good to see these guys in a context other than their basement - a lot more
people deserve to see them play live.
