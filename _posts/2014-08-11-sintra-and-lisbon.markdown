I'm sat here struggling to string together even a few words to say about our
little visit to Sintra, its surrounding area, and Lisbon.  Some places
genuinely take you by surprise - in a good way - and that's exactly what
happened during our trip.  It was an amazing week on every level.  Even the
excuse for going was perfect: the wedding of a couple of very awesome people
indeed.

But at least I took a few photos while we were out and about - would've been
daft not to really...
