Two or three years back I was lucky enough to purchase some rare records off a
certain Mr. Joe McRedmond, who some of you might know as one of the members of
[Hoover](http://www.dischord.com/band/hoover) and [The Crownhate Ruin](http://www.dischord.com/band/crownhate-ruin) We exchanged a few emails
and he offered up some unreleased TCR tracks which I downloaded, listened to,
and that was that.  He's mighty nice, is Joe.

Fast forward a couple of years to late last year, when I uploaded these
unreleased tracks for a friend of mine to my webserver for her to download. 
Some time later a blog that I follow posted the final chapter in an excellent
series regarding the [genealogy of Hoover](http://hardcorefornerds.blogspot.com/search/label/Hoover%20Genealogy%20Project), where I mentioned these unreleased
tracks and offered to make them available.  Anyway, I guess somehow word got
around and Joe posted the link to these on his Facebook with the following
comment: 

{% blockquote %} 

Some unreleased not very good, poorly recorded The Crownhate Ruin songs with
Alex joining us, and David Titus Batista on drums. I'll be surprised if you
enjoy it.

{% endblockquote %}

At this point I felt like a dick as obviously I hadn't checked with him
beforehand if it was cool before essentially making these publicly available. 
But, as I've mentioned, he's a mighty nice chap and he's totally cool with
these being online.

So anyway, enough waffle.  I'm posting this to make them 'formally' available
as I've no intention of taking them down in light of Joe's blessing.
