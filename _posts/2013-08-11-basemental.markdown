Saturday night, at an undisclosed location in deepest darkest Manchester, we
witnessed [Hell Ride Death Punk Blues](http://hellridedeathpunkblues.com) tear
up a basement for a miniscule crowd of people.  And what a treat.  I did my
best to grab some photos of the occassion, couple of my faves are below and be
sure to check the rest on
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yankcrime/sets/72157635031239380/).

Keep an ear (and an eye) out for these guys... They've got big plans, and
rightfully so.
