The Budweiser ['wassup'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W16qzZ7J5YQ) advert
sparked quite a few parodies back in its day - including some from the company
itself, but there was one in particular I was especially fond of in which the
'wasssuuuup's were replaced by Yorkshiremen saying 'ey up' instead.  Fast
forward a few years and a conversation with my girlfriend resulted in me trying
to rediscover this lost gem but to no avail.  No searches on Youtube or any
strings I tried in Google* revealed what I was looking for, so I basically gave
up.

Until now.

You can thank the one and only [Fletch](http://fletch.cx) for this, as I
happened upon on email of his - purely by chance - back from the beginning of
2001 with this attached.  I've found a shit-ton of emails going way back to
1997, so I'll no doubt bore you with some more blasts from the pasts later. 
Current ideas include various Minor Threat Q2 demos, early email signatures of
the rich and famous (ScanmaN, Shad, Boothy...) and so on.
