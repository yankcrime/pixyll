Countless times I've looked on [Knockhill's](http://www.knockhill.co.uk)
website and wondered (often out loud) about driving the short distance from
Edinburgh to check out some of the events there.  And so finally, me and my Dad
made the trip up there (a whole 25 minutes!) to watch the second day of
arguably the biggest weekend on the calendar - the Dunlop MSA British Touring
Car Championship.

The day included support from the Porsche Carrera Cup as well as SMRC and the
Ginetta GT series.  Our luck was in with the weather as the sun shined all day
long - we've somehow managed to come home with sunburn.  Not what you expect
early September in Scotland!

The racing was fantastic and lived up to all the hype surrounding BTCC;
Knockhill is a short and aggressive circuit which seems to lend itself well to
the touring car style.  We witnessed numerous shunts, dodgy overtake manouvres,
spinoffs, and so on - the sort of thing you'd almost never get to see at a
level like Formula One.  All in all it was a fantastic day out, hopefully the
photos I captured reflect that.  

Some of my favourites below, otherwise [check them all out on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yankcrime/sets/72157627593424706/show/).
