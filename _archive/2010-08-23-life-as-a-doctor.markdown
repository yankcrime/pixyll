Our mate* Rob has recently qualified, after many many years studying and hard
work, as a bona-fide doctor.  Many's the time along the way that we've
questioned his chosen career path (not that it's our place to, but such is the
Internet), as his attitude towards people in general isn't really in line with
what you'd expect from someone who is going to have the life of others in his
hands.  Odds are that this is just general Internet bravado, but you never
know.

Anyway, Rob is a top chap and has recently found himself newly qualified in the
field of whatever it is that doctors have after six or eight years of study.
 His recent forays into IRC have sounded pretty grim to say the least, but this
latest outburst is a real winner:

```

[19:49] [rob] and no she wasnt hot, nick.

[20:35] [Durz|lnx] rob realising its not like off the TV :/
[20:35] [Durz|lnx] i missed the episode of ER where they stuck a finger up an 84 year olds ass
```

I think I'll stick to IT.  Which, ironically, Rob already has a degree in
(Computer Science).

* someone on IRC that I've been speaking to for &gt; 10 years but haven't actually met.
