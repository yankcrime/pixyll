This past weekend, RAF Fairford once again played host to the 40th Royal
International Air Tattoo.  It's become something of an annual (more or less)
trip for me and my old man, I'm not much of a plane nerd by any stretch of the
imagination but I do love the noise and the excuse to shoot a few photos and
sit around outside drinking beer.

Speaking of photography, each successive year sees me trying to upgrade my
equipment in some way in order to get closer to the action.  I first shot wih a
D70 and a 70-200, then a D200, then a D700 + 1.7x Teleconverter (which got me
back to square one...) and then this year I borrowed a
[friend's](http://www.mark90.co.uk) D300s which, in conjunction with the TC and
the 70-200, had me as close as I've gotten so far.  Still need that 200-400
though really...

Annoyingly, the weather and the selection of planes was far worse than it's
been on previous occasions but I still managed to bag quite a few keepers (~80
or so out of about 400), half of which I've stuck up online.  Here's a few of
my favourites below, otherwise check out [the set on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yankcrime/sets/72157627231429952/show/).
