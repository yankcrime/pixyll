While searching around for Cray-related imagery I stumbled across
[Lawrence-Livermore National Laborotory](http://llnl.gov)'s Flickr stream.
There's some fantastic shots in here of all kinds of exotic machinery and
science-related shenanigans, but of particular interest to a nerd like myself
is the [Supercomputing set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/llnl/sets/72157607095353864/).

It's a great collection of photographic history dating back to 1952, and
includes more recent installations such as their "Tri-Lab Linux Capacity
Clusters", BlueGene/L, and most things in between.  Check out the full set in
the link above, it's fascinating stuff.
