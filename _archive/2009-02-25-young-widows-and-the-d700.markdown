After a couple of months without a camera (the D200 was sold to [this chap](http://www.mark90.co.uk)!) I finally took the plunge and whacked a Nikon
D700 + MB-D10 on my recently-cleared credit card.  That's what it's for after
all, right?!  Anyway, it arrived yesterday just in time for me to rush out
(literally) and shoot Young Widows at The Fly in Camden.

I was hoping that it'd be a decent test of the much-lauded low-light
capabilities of the FX sensor, but Young Widow's lighting arrangement would
have been a stretch to say the least.  They provided their own illumination by
way of just four lamps at the back, with the rest of the stage lighting turned
off.  I pulled out the SB-800 and rattled off a few keepers:

The gig itself was fucking superb, with YW playing a blinding albeit short
set.  Likewise the D700 although I haven't really scratched the surface of what
it can do yet. The rest are up on Flickr - [check them out](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yankcrime/sets/72157614334608367/show/).
