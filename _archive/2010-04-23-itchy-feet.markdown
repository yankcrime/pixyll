I can't believe how quickly the last year has gone, but we (me and Rox) have
made a decision to move back to the UK towards the end of summer and this week
I handed my notice in at work.

To be fair, the motivation wasn't really the passing of time, instead there's
been a number of personal / family related stuff going on which when they're
all factored together means that somewhere closer to home is the best place to
be for us both, for now.

We've had an amazing time out here in Darmstadt,  it's a cool place and we've
made some great friends.  But if we don't start making plans now then before we
know it another year will have passed and well, you know how that goes.

I have a three month notice period to work, so it'll be mid to late July before
I start seriously job hunting.  If you hear of anything that would suit, let me
know!
