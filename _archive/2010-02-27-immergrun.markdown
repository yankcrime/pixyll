I dusted off the D700 last night to take some shots of Rox's friend's band,
[Immergrün](http://www.myspace.com/immergruenrocks), at the Schlosskeller here
in Darmstadt.  It's a pretty cool little venue but awkward to take photos, as
while it's fairly intimate there's huge columns in the way (well, it is a
cellar...) that kind of limit your options.  Anyway, I got a few decent shots -
nothing groundbreaking, but it felt good to be at a gig and shooting some
pictures.  

It's always kind of hard to take photos of a band whose music you aren't
familiar with, as you don't know when they're going to build up and kick off,
those being the moments that you want to capture.  Still, these guys were
pretty tight and didn't seem to mind me making a nuisance of myself at the
front.
