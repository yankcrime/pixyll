I must admit to being slightly depressed by the fact that when I dusted the
D700 off for this year's BTCC event at Knockhill Circuit, one of the two cards
I use still had last year's pictures on it.  Yup, I've used my camera so little
over the last 12 months I hadn't even had the need to format it.

Anyway, this year marked the 20th anniversary of the event at Knockhill
Circuit.  They wheeled out a few previous Scottish legends and had them do a
couple of laps in some older cars which was pretty cool to see.  Disappointed
that there were no BMW E30 M3s doing the rounds but I guess no Scottish driver
ever competed in one of those?

The BTCC racing itself on the Sunday was typically manic with countless shunts
and appearances by the safety car.  I did my best to take photos that were from
different spots around the circuit as last year, on the whole I managed to
shoot 609 images of which are large percentage were keepers.  They all start to
get a bit samey though so I've whittled that down to less than 50 which are up
on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yankcrime/sets/72157631269761848/show/).  

Personally I think I still prefer to see some of the classics hoon around the
circuit, but unfortunately the early scheduling on Sunday meant that I missed
the race.  I also really like seeing the Porsche Carrera Cup rounds as well,
they're almost as aggressive as the BTCC crowd.

A few of my very favourites are below...
