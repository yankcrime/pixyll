Finally - Mat Hoffman is being honoured by a
[documentary](http://30for30.espn.com/film/birth-of-big-air.html) that covers
his legendary status and contributions not just in BMX Freestyle but for
extreme sports in general.  I kind of feel like although he's revered by most
people who know about bike riding, he doesn't always receive the wider
recognition that he so badly deserves.  Hopefully this will help set the record
straight.

<blockquote>Mat is awesome as shit, so we decided to make a movie about him.

I'm super stoked on the trailer, right from the opening with Fugazi and of
course Tony Hawk this seems like it'll be spot-on.  Can't wait.
