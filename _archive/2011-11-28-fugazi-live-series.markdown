<blockquote>

Between 1987 and 2003, Fugazi played over 1000 concerts in all 50 states and
all over the world. Over 800 of these shows were recorded by the band's sound
engineers.

You should already be well aware of this given that it reached the [New York Times frontpage](http://boingboing.net/2011/11/26/fugazi-on-nytimes-com-front-pa.html),
but as this has been a [long time coming](http://dischord.org/blog/2004/04/21/fugazi-live-recordings/) (in
various forms) - I figured I'd mention it here as well.  The NYT article points
out another interesting aspect:

<blockquote>

the project also tells a story about musical technology from the 1980s
into the 2000s. The earliest recordings were made on cassettes, then came
digital DAT tapes, then CD-R’s and a few hard drives.
