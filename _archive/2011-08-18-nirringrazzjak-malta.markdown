Me and the missus just spent a fantastic 10 days sunning it up on the cheap in
Malta.  I came away qualified as a Scuba Diver, and as if that wasn't
productive enough, I even took some photos!  

Favourite thing to shoot was definitely the random selection of cars we came
across, although it's a shame I didn't decide to start collecting them a little
bit sooner.  Still grabbed a few decent ones though - [check them out on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yankcrime/sets/72157627333442837/show/).
