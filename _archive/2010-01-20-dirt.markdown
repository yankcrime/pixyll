Back in around '96 / '97, myself and [Ben](http://www.aggroman.co.uk) used to
update a little website that we named 'Dirt', with some reviews of BMX videos,
music, and information on various 'scenes' around the UK.  The inspiration came
mainly from [Kieran Chapman](http://www.keiranchapman.net) eWire e-zine, and
while it was fun to do at the time we lost interest and it never received the
number of updates it deserved.  Fast forward a few years and I notice that I
seem to have lost all the versions I thought I had archived :(

Fortunately, I've found the last version published up on the Wayback Machine
and with the help of [Warrick](http://warrick.cs.odu.edu/) retrieved it complete
and intact and put it [back online here](http://dischord.org/misc/dirt/).  It's
pretty cringeworthy in places, from the design (made with NetObjects' Fusion
2.x! through to our writing.  

The photos were mainly stolen scans from [Dig Magazine](http://digbmx.com) although Will did kindly give us blessing to do so
- or Big Brother, hence Jamie Thomas over there.  Good shit!
