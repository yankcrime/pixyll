My good friend Greg and his cohorts, known collectively as [Married to the
Sea](http://www.marriedtothesea.co.uk), rolled into Darmstadt late yesterday to
play an acoustic set at a locally (in)famous and unusual venue known as the
Gute Stube.  It offered an ideal opportunity to bust out the camera and test
out some low-light shooting of which I've done very little with the D700.  In
short, I was blown away - not just by the music, but by the fact that I was
snapping away quite happily at ISO 3,200 and coming out with fantastic results.

Anyway, yeah - the gig!  The band were fantastic, winning the crowd over not
just with their music but also with their infectious charm and humour in this
very intimate venue.  Even if the songs weren't necessarily your cup of tea you
couldn't help but smile and just enjoy being a part of the event, it was great
fun and hopefully I've managed to capture some of that.

Below is a few of my favourite shots from the night, and the full set is over
