I've owned the domain 'freebsd.cx' for a number of years and it's got a certain <a title="Wayback Archives for freebsd.cx" href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://freebsd.cx" target="_blank">amount of history behind it</a> that a few of you may remember.  However, given CoCCA's recent price hikes (50 USD a year!) and the fact that it's now only used by a couple of people for email mean that I'm disinclined to fork out for the renewal fee.

If you're still using an @freebsd.cx address I can offer you @xen.cx instead, otherwise consider it dead.  RIP!
